# Smart Home With Arduino and Android


## ABSTRACT

Smart home systems are a new design development that has been started to be developed recently and is expected to spread widely in the future. In addition, smart home systems can not only turn devices on and off, but also monitor instantaneous activities in the indoor environment. At the same time, smart home technology is a technology where many features in the home are automated and creates an environment where devices can communicate with each other. In addition, smart home systems save energy and protect users from a heavy expense.

Today, lamps, fans and other electrical tools in the home can also be used thanks to smart home automations. In this project, an Arduino development board based smart home system project using bluetooth is explained. It is a project that can be highly preferred by users thanks to its affordable cost and easy use. All electronic devices can be managed using the user's smartphone.

In this project, HC-06 Arduino Bluetooth Module and Arduino Uno R3 development board used in various project ideas. In addition, LDR and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, which are used as light sensors, are integrated to provide reactions according to light, temperature and humidity conditions in the environment.

**Used Items:**

* Arduino Uno R3
* HC-06 Bluetooth Module
* LDR Sensor
* DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
